# European-Football-analysis

### Introduction

>I will be performing an analysis on the European Football dataset gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer), this data set contains match information about 25979 games, players, and teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016.

### Some of the questions that will be answered through the analysis of this dataset include:

> What is the most likely occurence in a game between(Home win, away win or draw)?
> 
> What teams have had the most wins  over the time period? 
> 
> What is the average goal scored per game in the european leagues?
> 
> Which teams conceeded the most goals within the period ?
> 
> Which of the top five european leagues is the most competitive?

### Conclusions


>At the end of this interesting data analysis. I discovered some unexpected facts about the football teams and leagues. Here are some of the insights I ganered:

>Between a Home win, draw and an away win, the most frequent occurence in this dataset is a home win 45.87% , followed by an away win 28.7, and finally the least frequent is a draw with 25.39%

>Fc Barcelona of Spain had the most wins during the period with 234 wins, closely followed by their la liga rivals Real Madrid with 228 wins


>The Eredivisie has the highest number of goals per game with 3.08 goals on average over 2448 games, followed by the Switzerland Super League with 2.9 goals on average in 1422 games


>SV Werder Bremen(Bundesliga) Conceeded 471 goals over the period followed by ADO Den Haag(Eredivisie) who conceeded 468 goals in the period

>The English Premier league and The French ligue 1 seems to be the most competitive of the top five european league, with 4 and 5 different winners respectively between 2008 and 2015, ligue 1 also had 11 different teams making the top 4 places, while the Epl has a 5.6 point gap on average between the top two teams, with the 2011/12 season decided by goal difference between the red and blue half of Manchester.

**Limitations:**

>This analysis was done considering the points, league winners and top 4 teams to decide which league was the most competitive, however other metrics could have been used 

>The matches dataset only contains values from the 2008 to 2015 season, an updated data will be needed for a more current analysis
